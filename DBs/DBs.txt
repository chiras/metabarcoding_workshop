Reference databases can be added here. However for the the workflow to work, these must be ```FASTA``` files with taxonomic annotation in the header. 
Examples of such files are available here: 

Bacteria and fungi: https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/sintax_downloads.html
Plant ITS2: https://zenodo.org/record/7968519 or Europe only: https://zenodo.org/record/7970046

Manual creation of such databases from NCBI Genbank: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/8/2630/5697086?login=false
